This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Personal project completed while a student at Devmountain.  I used React as my javascript framework.  Node.js and Express was used for my backend server side set up along with Massive to incorporate sessions.  The database was created using Postgresql.  

Features include customer navigation of the shop with user authentication registering and signin.  Nodemailer was used to send welcome emails to customers.  Customers may navigate the store and purchase products from the Lynne and Lee shop.  Customers can have peace of mind while purchasing their items with the secure checkout and payment of Slide.

Shop owner features include admin authentication during the sign in process to give access to edit features of products and seeing shop statistics of revenue and most purchased items.
